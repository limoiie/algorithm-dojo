//We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: 
//
// I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked. 
//
// Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is high
//er or lower. 
//
// However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $
//x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked. 
//
// Example: 
//
// 
//n = 10, I pick 8.
//
//First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
//Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
//Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
//
//Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
//
//You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
// 
//
// Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarant
//ee a win. Related Topics Dynamic Programming Minimax
